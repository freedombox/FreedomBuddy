#+TITLE: Issues, Explained
#+OPTIONS: d:t

Issues are stored as [[http://orgmode.org][Org Mode]] files using [[http://www.taskjuggler.org][TaskJuggler]]-similar [[http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/task.html][properties]] to
allow easy export to almost any format, including a TaskJuggler project list.

* Structure

The basic structure of these files is:

1. A title.
2. Some metadata, stored in a [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Properties-and-Columns.html#Properties-and-Columns][Property-drawer]].
3. A description of the issue.
4. Potential fixes.
5. Any issue-related discussion.

* Properties as Metadata

To integrate better with TaskJuggler, consider using properties TaskJuggler
recognizes:

- complete :: 0 - 100
- priority :: 1 - 1000
- responsible :: a person
- precedes :: another bug that can't be handled until this one
- depends :: a bug that must be handled before this one
- effort :: time, in workdays, required to fix the issue

Some non-TaskJuggler properties might also be useful:

- Related :: related issues (similar, but not blocking or blocked)
- Duplicate :: a duplicate issue
- Status :: open/closed, incomplete/complete, invalid
- Severity :: The issue's overall impact.  With frequency, determines priority.
- Frequency :: How often the issue occurs.  With severity, determines priority.

The only ones I ever really bother using are:

- blocking :: an alternate form of precedes
- blocked :: an alternate form of depends
- owner :: an alternate form of responsible
- status :: an alternate form of complete that allows for "invalid" percentages
- priority :: the order issues will be tackled in
