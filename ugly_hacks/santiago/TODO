   The port could already be in use.

   The cert-file might not exist.

  replace the list of known FBuddy locations with the reply from the
  server:

  - [X] [[file:santiago.py::self.create_consuming_location(host,%20self.reply_service,%20reply_to)][file:santiago.py::self.create_consuming_location(host, self.reply_service, reply_to)]]

  - [X] [[file:santiago.py::self.create_consuming_location(client,%20self.reply_service,%20reply_to)][file:santiago.py::self.create_consuming_location(client, self.reply_service, reply_to)]]

* TODO figure out what other request types FBuddies should request
   from one another.

   - request "all services for this client"

  If they don't reply in that time, it times out and should be cleaned up.

* TODO move hosting and consuming back to defaultdicts              :cleanup:

  The syntax is just so much cleaner and shorter.  Implied getters and setters.
