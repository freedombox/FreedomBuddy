* Issue

  Creating a self-testing package will simplify testing the FreedomBuddy system
  in several ways:

  - Automatic data collection (no user intervention or interpretation).

  - Testing connections to a variety of hosts in a series of destination
    countries.

  - Testing all available connection methods.

  - Automatic connection and performance problem reporting and diagnosis.

  - Repeated connection attempts over a period of time and at different times of
    day.
