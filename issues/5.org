* Issue

  Optionally run FreedomBuddy without PGP.

  This removes the key-exchange requirement and allows fully anonymous access by
  clients.  It would also make it possible to publish a public service list in
  case of a general service shutdown or other situations where accessibility is
  more important than the host's anonymity or privacy.

  Both J and S requested this: one for privacy and resilience, the other for
  accessibility and resilience.  Either way, we're removing a constraint, making
  the system more flexible.

** Constraints

   FBuddy could not encrypt messages between clients.

   We could fake the key id and make integration easy by using a reserved key
   id, like 0.  Get a request, pull the service list from the 0 key.

*** Replies

    This also changes the reply setup, because each reply location would *have*
    to be transmitted with each request.  If all clients are the same client, we
    need to differentiate them, which we can do only once per request.  This
    means either:

    - Requests block.

    - I find some other way to mark request reply locations for the duration of
      the request.

    Reply locations are currently recorded for the client at the beginning of
    the request.  Multiple, overlapping, requests for a single client would
    stomp on one another's reply locations.  So, we can't treat them all as a
    single client, they're now request-specific.  Not a big deal for most
    web-apps, but we need to play it carefully here, to make sure we store
    request data differently depending on the context.  That's damn annoying.

*** Flooding

    Does this simplify or reduce flooding concerns at all?  Possibly.  Without
    decrypting, messages become much easier to handle.
