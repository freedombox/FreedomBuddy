* Issue

  There are Blammos.  They point to significant failings in the code and must be
  fixed before the code is used by others.

* Fixes [1/3]

** DONE Remove GET, use POST [2/2]

   Seriously.  I did it right in [[file:~/programs/freedombox/freedombuddy/src/connectors/https/controller.py::if%20action%20%3D%3D%20"POST":][HTTPS Connector::420]].

*** DONE [[file:~/programs/freedombox/freedombuddy/src/connectors/https/controller.py::#%20FIXME%20Blammo!][HTTPS Connector::78]] Only allow POST.

** TODO [[file:~/programs/freedombox/freedombuddy/src/connectors/https/controller.py::117][HTTPS Connector::117]] Make sure HTTPS connection is secure

   I might need both a key and a cert verified correctly.  Figure out how to use
   httplib.HTTPSConnection correctly.

   As in the [[file:cli-socket.org][cli-socket]] issue, this can be considered a security hole, given how
   the ~httplib.HTTPSConnection~ doesn't validate the certificates.  So, you
   could easily, accidentally, and unknowingly connect to an untrusted server.

** TODO [[file:~/programs/freedombox/freedombuddy/src/connectors/https/controller.py::122][HTTPS Connector::122]] Make sure connections are appropriately proxied

   I'm certain there are other proxying functions, but I don't recall them.
   Python supported proxying before version 2.7, and that's just stupid and
   broken.

   +Perhaps I should just avoid proxying for now, until I figure out the proxying
   and searching issues.+  We're talking about HTTP proxying, not request
   proxying, so, yes, this needs to be solved.
