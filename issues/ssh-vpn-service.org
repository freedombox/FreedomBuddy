* Issue

  We need to read FreedomBuddy data to configure an [[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH_VPN][SSH VPN]], similar to how the
  [[file:~/programs/freedombox/freedombuddy/src/scripts/openvpn/static-key_client.py][Open VPN client]] does it.  We have two options:

  1. Edit =/etc/network/interfaces= and restart the network service.

  2. Plough a bunch of networking commands through as the super user.

  Not really sure which one'd be easier, I almost think editing the interfaces
  file might be, if I can make (or use) a decent /etc/network/interfaces editor.
